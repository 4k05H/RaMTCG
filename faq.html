            ABOUT THE GAME:
            Rules:
            Each player has a deck with a minimum of 20 cards and a maximum is 50. <br>
          When the battle begins, players get 5 cards and then the game draws which player to start with. <br>
            Only one card can be played in each round, unless you have a card on the court that entitles you to more. <br>
            When playing a hero, we place the card in the top row ... when laying down, the hero can't attack yet, only on the next turn. The buff cards go under the hero cards, and that buff card only applies to the hero under it, the buff card cannot be removed from the hero (unless you play an entitlement card) and 1 hero can only have one buff card. At the end of the rounds, ALWAYS draw enough cards to have exactly 5 cards in your hand. A card can only be played if your point does not exceed your number of points, after playing a card, the number of points on the card will be deducted from your points. <br>
          Attack: <br> In each round you can attack twice or activate an ability. You can only attack an opponent with your heroes whose defense point does not exceed the attack points on your card ... if the attack and defense points are equal then both heroes die and both sides get points for the hero, if there are more attack points than defense only the attacked hero dies and only the attacker gets points for the hero. Dead heroes and their buffs are taken to the cemetery.<br>
